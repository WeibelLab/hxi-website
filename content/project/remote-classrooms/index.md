### Overview
The COVID-19 outbreak prompted a swift shift to remote classrooms. For many instructors and students this was their first experience with online education. Unlike prior online learning systems, students had complete agency in how they participated in class, such as they chose when to share videos or how to ask questions. 

This work presents the first results on students' and instructors' behaviours in synchronous online classrooms. Interview and survey studies revealed breakdowns in student-instructor and student-student interactions which (as discussed in the study) can be mitigated with strategies like flexible distribution of video feeds.
