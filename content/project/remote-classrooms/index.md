### Overview
Expedited by the COVID-19 outbreak, remote  learning is now an inescapable part of education. Many instructors and students are transitioning into online set-ups, yet the current learning tools are not fully suited for teaching and learning needs at unique training domains. This can have detrimental impacts on the quality of learning and well-being of the stakeholders.

In this line of works, we first identify and contextualize the breakdowns of remote learning in different settings, such as formal undergraduate education, MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) users, and healthcare training. We then aim to improve remote learning by leveraging minimally-invasive user context and providing timely AI and peer support. 

Our works in this space are well-recognized in the media: <a href="https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/feature/it-feels-like-im-talking-into-a-void-how-do-we-improve-the-virtual-classroom">UC San Diego News Center</a>, <a href="https://technews.acm.org/archives.cfm?fo=2021-06-jun/jun-14-2021.html">ACM TechNews</a>, <a href="https://www.engineering.com/story/student-research-aims-to-improve-nonverbal-communication-in-virtual-classrooms">Engineering.com</a>, <a href="https://csealumnimagazine.ucsd.edu/the-ongoing-pandemic-challenge">CSE Alumni Magazine</a>
