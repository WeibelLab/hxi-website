### Overview

While 3D annotations are often used for sketching, higher VR resolutions and new drawing modalities open the way to a new paradigm that we call Precision–First 3D Drawing. Realizing this paradigm is important for precise 3D tasks like surgical telestration, medical contouring, and automotive design. However, due to lack of physical support, limited depth perception, and non–planar nature of 3D curves, it is challenging to adjust mid–air strokes to achieve high precision. We investigate how task geometric shapes and input modalities affect precision–first drawing performance in a within–subject study (n =12) focusing on 3D target tracing in commercially available VR systems. We found that compared to using hands, VR controllers and pens yield nearly 30% gain, and that the tasks with large curvature, forward–backward or left–right orientations perform best. We outline key characteristics of precision–first drawing and create opportunities for novel interaction techniques for precise delineation in 3D.
