### Overview

Specialized surgeries are often needed in places where there is no access to surgeons, and timely access to telemedicine helps novice surgeons save lives.

While modern telesurgery is limited to just audio/video, **ARTEMIS** enables skilled surgeons and novices to share the same virtual space.

In ARTEMIS, expert surgeons in remote sites use *Virtual Reality* to access a 3D reconstruction of a patient’s body, and instruct novice surgeons on complex procedures as if they were together in the operating room. Novice surgeons in the field can focus on saving the patient’s live while being guided through an intuitive *Augmented Reality* interface.
