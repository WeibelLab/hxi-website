### Overview

ReCODE Health is here to support technologists, researchers, ethicists, regulators, institutions and participants involved in the digital health research process. Our value proposition is to increase awareness of ethical principles and practices from the earliest stages of technology design to the deployment of digital health research.

*For Technology Creators* -- We offer assistance in developing Terms of Service and End User Licensing Agreements that don't conflict with Federal Regulations for protecting research participants. Researchers can then use your measurement product in digital health research.

*For Researchers*<br/>
We provide protocol development consultation, education and decision-making tools.

*For Participants*<br/>
We offer checklists to help you make decisions about participating in digital health research.

*For Institutions*<br/>
We conduct risk analysis assessments with a goal of increasing awareness of the unknown unknowns that are inherent in digital health research.

*For Ethicists*<br/>
We work with you to apply ethical principles to digital health research.
