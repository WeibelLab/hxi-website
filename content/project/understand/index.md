### Overview

Many college students experience comorbid depression and anxiety, exacerbating symptom severity and functional impairment. While evidence-based treatments like CBT and DBT demonstrate efficacy, they lack real-time, context-aware delivery at moments of heightened distress.

We are developing a mobile health (mHealth) system that leverages ubiquitous computing, wearable sensing, and machine learning to detect physiological and socio-behavioral indicators of distress in situ. Upon detection, the system delivers Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAI) informed by DBT principles to provide personalized, contextually relevant support.

By targeting transdiagnostic mechanisms such as emotional dysregulation, interpersonal challenges, and cognitive distortions, our approach aims to improve scalability and relevance across diverse populations with comorbid mood and anxiety disorders.

<!-- ### Funding and External Collaborations

UnBIASED ia a 5-year project, funded by the National Library of Medicine (NLMR01LM013301), and it is a collaboration between the University of Washington and the [HXI Lab](https://hxi.ucsd.edu) at UC San Diego. Our ultimate goal is to create tools to support patients and the next generation of doctors to have bias-free interactions that promote healthcare access, quality, and equity.
