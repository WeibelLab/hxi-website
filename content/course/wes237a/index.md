### Course Description
WES 237A - Introduction to Embedded System Design - is a Masters of Advanced Study course in the Wireless and Embedded Systems (WES) program.

The course provides an introduction to embedded systems that stresses practical, hands-on experience with wirelessly connected embedded systems. Students utilize state of the art tools to create novel embedded systems utilizing the PYNQ Z-2 (Links to an external site.) board, and a range of Internet of Things (IOT) sensors and wireless devices.

The course teaches aspects of hardware and software architectures, peripherals and on-board communication protocols, hardware and software input/output interfaces, and real time constraints, combining these concept with a close coupling with the ARM architecture and various synthesized hardware blocks.

Students  build their knowledge and experience through five labs that culminate in a final IOT project that will allow them to build a working system based on a variety of sensors and I/O components.

 
### Learning Objectives
After successfully completing this course, a student will have:

- Knowledge of embedded systems, peripherals, and communication protocols.
- Expertise in C-based coding of ARM architectures utilizing a variety of soft-IP cores and interfaces.
- Familiarity with the Xilinx Zynq SoC architecture and tools necessary for development of its embedded core, including the Python-based Jupyter interface
- Experience working with, and coding for, wirelessly connected embedded systems
- An understanding of the real-time tradeoffs of implementing functionality in software vs hardware.
