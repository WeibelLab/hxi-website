Yes, of course you can!


### Courses and Programs
Please take a look at our current [teaching engagements](/teaching), but also consider other classes in the context of HCI, Human-Centered Design, Ubiquitous Computing, etc. You can find more information on these offerings here:

- [Undergraduate and Graduate Design and HCI Related Courses](https://designlab.ucsd.edu/education/design-courses-at-ucsd/)
- [M.S. in Computer Sciecen, Human-Computer Interaction Depth](https://cse.ucsd.edu/graduate/degree-programs/ms-program/ms-2015-comp-standard#)
- [B.S. in CogSci with a Specialization in Design and Interaction](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/undergraduates/major/design-interaction.html)


### Human-Centered Design Graduate Specialization
If you are a graduate student, please consider the Graduate Students Specialization in Human-Centered Design

The graduate specialization is a set of courses students can choose to take that fits into their home degree program requirements. It is analogous to receiving a minor, but at the graduate level. As such, the specialization does not alter home program requirements. Instead, the courses fit into their home program as either electives or as courses that were already part of their core requirements. The graduate specialization is created so that it can be integrated into a one- or two-year masterâ€™s program or PhD program
