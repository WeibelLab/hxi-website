Are you interested in our software and tools? We are happy to share as much as we can of our software, experimental materials, and data whenever possible. 

For our data and experimental materials, please review [our publications](/publication) first, and then contact us with very specific requests. Note that many of our data contain private information, and often have to adhere to the HIPAA laws for Proteced Health Information (PHI), so we might not be able to share everything. Typically, a Data Use Agreement (DUA) is necessary between UCSD and your institution for sharing data

You can find most of our software and tools on the [HXI Lab Github Page](https://github.com/WeibelLab). In addition, you can find more information on specific tools that the HXI lab and their collaborators developed under these pages.
