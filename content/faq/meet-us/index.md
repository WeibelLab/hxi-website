Yes! We are lookng forward to meet you, if you have an interest in any of our projects or research.

The best way to meet us is to [come by our offices or our research space in CSE or DIB](/contact). If we are giving a talk at a conference or research meeting, there are typically plenty of opportunities to meet after the talk/presentation. Also, you can come and talk to any of us at the end of our classes at UCSD.

If you want to join our lab, please take a look at [this page](/faq/join-us) that have lots of information.

In order to setup a meeting, please [get in contact with us](/faq/contact), so we can discuss the details of your meeting request.

If you want to invite a member of the lab to give a talk or a presentation, please [reach out directly](/people) to the person you would like to meet.
