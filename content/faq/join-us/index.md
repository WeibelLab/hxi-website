### Ph.D. Students
***For the academic year 2022/2023 the HXI lab is NOT looking for new Prospective Ph.D. Students.***

As a Ph.D. student you engage with the HXI lab over several years doing fundamental and applied research towards the accomplishment of your Ph.D. Thesis.

There are two main ways to enagage with the lab as a Ph.D. student:

- Include Prof. Weibel as one of your Ph.D. Committee Members *(Please see the information in our [dedicated page on Ph.D. Committees](/faq/phd-master-committees))*.
- As a Ph.D. student advised (or co-advised) by Prof. Weibel.

The latter case involves (1) [Applying to UCSD](https://apply.grad.ucsd.edu/home) as a Ph.D. Student, (2) [discuss with Prof. Weibel](/faq/contact) your research and graduate studies goals, and if there is a fit (3) secure a Ph.D. Student position for multiple years in the HXI Lab.

Ph.D. students in the HXI Lab typically graduate in 5 years, and are engaged in a number of [research projects](/research/) and [teaching activities](/teaching/). 

**Research**: As a lab we usually have a number of research projects funded by government agencies such as the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, by industrial partners, or by non-profit research organizations, and Ph.D. students are typically responsible for one or more objectives towards these projects. We also strive to secure individual research fellowship for Ph.D. students either theough government funding, or industry funding, to increase the independency from project-based funding for the Ph.D. student's research.

**Teaching**: UCSD Ph.D. students are typically require to teach at least one or two quarters throughout their Ph.D. (different departments have different rules). The HXI lab offers a number of classess across Computer Science and Design, and Ph.D. students will be regularly involved in these activities.

If you are interested in joining the HXI lab as a Ph.D. students **and** the lab is looking for Prospective students for the following academic year, you should [get in contact with Prof. Weibel](/faq/contact), or any of his current Ph.D. students or Postdocs at least one year before joining, ideally in the summer before applying to the Ph.D. program.

### Master Students
Master students can typically join the HXI Lab:

- as volunteer graduate research assistants (unpaid and no research credits)
- for research credits (E.g. [CSE 293](https://cse.ucsd.edu/graduate/courses/course-descriptions/cse293-special-project-computer-science-and-engineering))*
- as part of a Master Thesis lead by Prof. Weibel (E.g. [CSE 298](https://cse.ucsd.edu/graduate/courses/course-descriptions/cse298-ms-thesis-research))*
- by including Prof. Weibel as one of your MS Thesis Committee Members *(please see the information in our [dedicated page on Master Committees](/faq/phd-master-committees))*.
- as a paid Graduate Student Researcher (GSR)

\**Departments other than CSE might offer similar research credits or thesis opportunities. Please [discuss with Prof. Weibel](/faq/contact) your particular case, if it is not in CSE.*

We typically do not offer paid GSR to <b>new</b> Master Students. We also do not engage in a MS Thesis with students who did not already join the lab before their thesis. The usual path is to volunteer in the lab or take research credits, and then enquire about paid GSRs or being advised in a MS Thesis.

We encourage Master Students who fit within the scope of the HXI lab to extend their engagement to 2-3 quarters or more.

In order to engage with the HXI Lab as a Master Student, please look at [current projects](/research), and engage with the [students or postdocs](/people) working on projects that you are interested in. Also keep an eye out for emails that your major or department advisors might send out for opportunities for specific projects.

### Undergraduate Students
Undergraduate students can typically join the HXI Lab:

- as volunteer research assistants (unpaid)
- as part of a scheduled Directed Study Group (E.g. CSE/CogSci/DSGN 198)*
- as Indipendent Projects (e.g. CSE/CogSci/DSGN 199)*
- as a paid research assistant

\**If your department 198/199 is not listed above, it is typically possible to discuss with your major or department undergraduate advisors how would research in the HXI Lab count towards research credits.*

We typically do not offer paid reseach assistantships to <b>new</b> Undergraduate Students. The usual path is to (1) volunteer in the lab, (2) take research credits, and then (3) be offered a paid position if the students are working on a funded project.

We encourage undergraduate students who fit within the scope of the HXI lab to extend their engagement to 2-3 quarters or more.

In order to engage with the HXI Lab as an Undergraduate Student, please look at [current projects](/research), and engage with the [students or postdocs](/people) working on projects that you are interested in. Also keep an eye out for emails that your major or department advisors might send out for opportunities for specific projects.

### Postdoctoral Researcher
The HXI lab is always looking for talented Postdoctoral Researchers who would like to join the lab for at least 1-2 years.

If you are finishing your terminal graduate degree (Ph.D., M.D., M.F.A, etc.) in a related field, or if you already have a terminal graduate degree and are interested in the HXI lab's research, please [contact Prof. Weibel](/faq/contact) or any of his current Ph.D. students or Postdocs.

In order to join as a Postdoctal Scholars, funding for the Postdoc position should already be available. 

Typically Postdocs already have their source of funding (such as a scholarship or a fellowship), and in that case the prospective Postdoc should [get in contact with Prof. Weibel](/faq/contact) to discuss possibilities and next steps.

Sometimes we do have Postdoctoral Positions that opens to join existing research project, and we advertise these widely. So keep an eye out for emails on international mailing lists such as the ones on the [SIGCHI Listserv](https://sigchi.org/operations/listserv/) for opportunities as Postdoctoral Researcher for specific projects.

In case there is a research fit, but no current funding, please research possible funding avenues (including at the UC, UC San Diego, CSE, and DesignLab levels), make a list and consider deadlines, and then [get in contact with Prof. Weibel](/faq/contact). Typically we are happy to help with writing Postdoctoral Fellowship proposals, or help with funding to the extent that this is feasible.

If you are an international scholar, [UCSD's office of Postdoctoral Affairs](https://postdoc.ucsd.edu/) will assist you in securing visa and any other sponsoring documentation to enter the US, however keep in mind that this will take time, so please consider that time in your timeline.

### Visiting Researcher
We often have short and longer term visiting researchers join the HXI lab.

Visiting researchers are always volunteer and self-funded positions, and you need to already have an existing position in a different institution. Visiting Researchers can be at the Student, Postdoc or Facuty position, and will secure space and resources at UC San Diego for the length of your visiting time.

If you are interested in such a position, please [get in contact with Prof. Weibel](/faq/contact) to discuss the fit with the HXI lab and any of the existing projects, share your plan and timeline, as well as the most updated CV. Be prepared to show financial support documentation to UCSD in order to setup your appointment.

Typically we are able to set up Visiting Researcher positions in the CSE Department or the DesignLab.
