The **Human-centered eXtended Intelligence** Research Lab at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu) focuses on the design, development, and evaluation of interactive technology across Ubiquitous Computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), eXtended Reality, and immersive visualization. 

Our team, led byÂ [Dr. Nadir Weibel](https://www.ubicomp.ucsd.edu/weibel), investigates, designs and develops new tools, techniques and infrastructure that leverage the power of multimodal and pervasive sensing to first capture, quantify and understand human behavior and then support better interaction with information through the design and development of human-centered ubiquitous computing technology.
