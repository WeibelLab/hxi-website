The **Human-centered eXtended Intelligence** Research Lab focuses on the design, development and evaluation of interactive pervasive sensing technology to support health and healthcare. 

Our team, led byÂ [Dr. Nadir Weibel](https://www.ubicomp.ucsd.edu/weibel), investigates, designs and develops new tools, techniques and infrastructure that leverage the power of multimodal and pervasive sensing to track body and eye movements, speech, writing, as well as social interaction in the real world and online. This allows us to first capture, quantify and understand human behavior and then support better interaction with information through the design and development of human-centered ubiquitous computing technology that improve health and health care.
