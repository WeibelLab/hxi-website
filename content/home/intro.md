Our team, led by [Dr. Nadir Weibel](author/nadir-weibel/), investigates, designs, and develops new tools, techniques, and infrastructure to leverage the power of multimodal pervasive sensing and immersive visualization. We strive to first capture, quantify and understand human behavior, and then support better interaction with digital information. Our approach allows us to design and develop human-centered technology that extends human powers and intelligence beyond their current capacity.
