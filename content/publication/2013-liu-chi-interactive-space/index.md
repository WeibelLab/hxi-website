title: 'Interactive space: a prototyping framework for touch and gesture on and above the desktop'
subtitle: ''
summary: '<b>CHI 2013</b><br/>Framework supporting the rapid prototyping of touch and gesture interfaces in real-world settings using a portable system with semi-automatic calibration. Designed to enable evaluation of electronic medical record interfaces in clinical environments, it simplifies setup by combining on- and above-desktop interaction and includes an SDK and calibration tools. Preliminary evaluation highlights its flexibility and ease of use.'

abstract: 'Prototyping gestural and multitouch applications for desktop and mid-air interaction still requires expensive non-portable equipment, complex setup and calibration, and often reimplementation of tracking algorithms. We present Interactive Space, a prototyping framework designed to ease exploration of touch and gestural interaction in real-world settings. For us this is a first step in developing interfaces for electronic medical records to be evaluated in clinical settings. The main contribution is a simple flexible system that supports interaction on and above the desktop, and includes a semi-automatic calibration mechanism that makes it highly portable. We describe the framework, SDK, calibration method, limitations, availability, and a preliminary evaluation.'
