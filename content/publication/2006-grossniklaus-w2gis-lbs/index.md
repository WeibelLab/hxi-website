abstract: 'Location-based services for users on the move provide a convenient means of filtering information based on current geographical position. However users also often want to retrieve or capture information associated with past or future locations. We show how new technologies for interactive paper can be used to augment conventional paper maps with location-based services using a combination of user tracking and pointing to the map to specify location.'
