abstract: Discussion fora of instructional videos contain previously-discussed questions and answers. These video
comments can resolve many points of confusion for learners. However, finding relevant content in a separated
discussion forum is challenging and disruptive to learning flow. This paper introduces Adjacent Display of
Relevant Discussion (ADRD): it displays threaded comments in a panel adjacent to the video and dynamically
updates the content of the panel based on the time of the video. In a between-subjects lab study (n=20), ADRD
helped participants resolve confusion points, skim and read comments, and encouraged video interaction.
