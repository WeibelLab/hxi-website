title: 'Predicting trust in autonomous vehicles: Modeling young adult psychosocial traits, risk-benefit attitudes, and driving factors with machine learning'
subtitle: 'CHI 2025'
summary: '<b>CHI 2025</b><br>Trust in autonomous vehicles varies widely among individuals, and this study uses machine learning to identify the key factors influencing young adults’ trust. Surveying over 1,400 participants, the analysis reveals that perceptions of AV risks and benefits, usability attitudes, institutional trust, prior experience, and mental models are the strongest predictors of trust—while psychosocial traits and driving styles play a lesser role. These findings underscore the need to account for individual differences when designing trustworthy AV systems.'

abstract: 'Low trust remains a significant barrier to Autonomous Vehicle (AV) adoption. To design trustworthy AVs, we need to better understand the individual traits, attitudes, and experiences that impact people’s trust judgements. We use machine learning to understand the most important factors that contribute to young adult trust based on a comprehensive set of personal factors gathered via survey (n = 1457). Factors ranged from psychosocial and cognitive attributes to driving style, experiences, and perceived AV risks and benefits. Using the explainable AI technique SHAP, we found that perceptions of AV risks and benefits, attitudes toward feasibility and usability, institutional trust, prior experience, and a person’s mental model are the most important predictors. Surprisingly, psychosocial and many technology- and driving-specific factors were not strong predictors. Results highlight the importance of individual differences for designing trustworthy AVs for diverse groups and lead to key implications for future design and research.'
