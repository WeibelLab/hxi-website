title: 'Imagining Improved Interactions: Patients’ Designs To Address Implicit Bias'
subtitle: 'AMIA 2023'
summary: '<b>AMIA 2023</b><br>
Implicit biases in healthcare harm communication, decision-making, and care quality for marginalized patients. Through co-design workshops with 32 BIPOC, LGBTQ+, and QTBIPOC individuals, we identified four patient-centered solutions: accountability measures, real-time correction, enablement tools, and provider resources. These insights advance patient-focused approaches to addressing bias in care.'

abstract: 'Implicit biases may negatively influence healthcare providers’ behaviors toward patients from historically marginalized communities, impacting providers’ communication style, clinical decision-making, and delivery of quality care. Existing interventions to mitigate negative experiences of implicit biases are primarily designed to increase recognition and management of stereotypes and prejudices through provider-facing tools and resources. However, there is a gap in understanding and designing interventions from patient perspectives. We conducted seven participatory co-design workshops with 32 Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC), Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer/Questioning (LGBTQ+), and Queer, Transgender, Black, Indigenous, People of Color (QTBIPOC) individuals to design patient-centered interventions that help them address and recover from provider implicit biases in primary care. Participants designed four types of solutions: accountability measures, real-time correction, patient enablement tools, and provider resources. These informatics interventions extend the research on implicit biases in healthcare through inclusion of valuable, firsthand patient perspectives and experiences.'
