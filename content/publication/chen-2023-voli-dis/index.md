title: "How do Older Adults Set Up Voice Assistants? Lessons Learned from a Deployment Experience for Older Adults to Set Up Standalone Voice Assistants"
subtitle: 'DIS 2023'
summary: '<b>DIS 2023</b><br/>Older adults often face challenges when setting up voice assistants independently, especially without help from family or technicians. Through a within-subject study using both the Echo Dot and Echo Show, key barriers and supports were identified. The built-in screen and printed instructions proved helpful, with design insights highlighting how interface design and physical form factor can better promote autonomy in setup and use.'

abstract: 'While standalone Voice Assistants (VAs) are promising to support older adults’ daily routine and wellbeing management, onboarding and setting up these devices can be challenging. Although some older adults choose to seek assistance from technicians and adult children, easy set up processes that facilitate independent use are still critical, especially for those who do not have access to external resources. We aim to understand the older adults’ experience while setting up commercially available voice-only and voice-first screen-based VAs. Rooted in participants observations and semi-structured interviews, we designed a within-subject study with 10 older adults using Amazon Echo Dot and Echo Show. We identified the values of the built-in touchscreen and the instruction documents, as well as the impact of form factors, and outline important directions to support older adult independence with VAs.'
