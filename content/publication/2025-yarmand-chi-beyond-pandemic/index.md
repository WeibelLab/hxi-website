title: 'Interactions Beyond the Pandemic: Lessons Learned from Large-scale Emergency Remote Teaching in Higher Education'
subtitle: 'CHI 2025'
summary: '<b>CHI 2025</b><br>Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) during COVID-19 offered a unique chance to study online higher education at scale, beyond traditional lab settings. Through a review of 22 empirical studies, we analyzed how online classrooms addressed different types of interaction. Our findings highlight the need for future research that centers Learner-Content interaction as a way to balance flexibility with structure—especially as ERT may continue to shape education going forward.'

abstract: 'Online education — given the enhanced access for diverse populations and flexible participation — has been a topic of interest for many computer science and learning science researchers. The sudden shift to online settings during the COVID-19 Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) provided a valuable opportunity to examine the use of educational technologies on a global scale with various digital readiness skills, beyond many past works that relied on small lab studies. Following a PRISMA-inspired methodology grounded on Moore’s three types of classroom interaction, this descriptive review investigates 22 empirical research papers published during the COVID-19 ERT era focused on higher-education online classrooms. We explore the empirical evidence reported in the collected corpus, and given how ERT remains a likely future occurrence, we suggest key directions for future research, including a new learning paradigm that centralizes and augments Learner-Content interaction to balance between flexibility and structure of online learning.'
