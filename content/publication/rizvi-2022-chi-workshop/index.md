title: 'Making Hidden Bias Visible: Designing a Feedback Ecosystem for Primary Care Providers'
subtitle: 'CHI 2022'
summary: '<b>CHI 2022 - QT-BIPOC PD Workshop</b><br/>
 We present wireframes displaying communication metrics that negatively impact patient-centered care divided into the following categories: digital nudge, dashboard, and guided reflection. Our wireframes provide quantitative, real-time, and conversational feedback promoting provider reflection on their interactions with patients.'

abstract: 'Implicit bias may perpetuate healthcare disparities for marginalized patient populations. Such bias is expressed in communication between patients and their providers. We design an ecosystem with guidance from providers to make this bias explicit in patient-provider communication. Our end users are providers seeking to improve their quality of care for patients who are Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) and/or Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ). We present wireframes displaying communication metrics that negatively impact patient-centered care divided into the following categories: digital nudge, dashboard, and guided reflection. Our wireframes provide quantitative, real-time, and conversational feedback promoting provider reflection on their interactions with patients. This is the first design iteration toward the development of a tool to raise providers awareness of their own implicit biases.'
