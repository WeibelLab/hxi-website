title: 'Holo-Stroke-CTA: Stroke Hologram Teleportation for CTA Large Vessel Occlusion Assessments'
subtitle: 'Stroke: Vascular and Interventional Neurology'
summary: 'Augmented reality enables visualization of and interaction with both physical and virtual environments. Holograms can allow 3‐dimensional image transmission to distant sites, allowing patients to interact with providers as if in the same space. Our prior publication resulted in high satisfaction/immersion for patients interacting with Holo‐Stroke providers. Our aim here was to determine if providers assessing computed tomographic angiographies (CTAs) for large vessel occlusion would result in reliability and satisfaction.'
