title: 'Plink: paper-based links for cross-media information spaces'
subtitle: ''
summary: '<b>CHI 2011</b><br/>Plink uses printed paper as hyperlinks to digital content by embedding touch-sensitive markers; tapping a page region with a digital pen opens related multimedia or web pages on a nearby device. This cross-media linking blends physical and digital reading seamlessly, reducing context switching. User tests report improved information retrieval speed and user satisfaction over manual lookups.'

abstract: 'PLink is a system for integrating physical and computer desktops by creating paper links to digital resources. PLink leverages diverse formats of physical paper, ranging from tiny stickers that can be easily incorporated into traditional paper media to very large deskpad sheets that make the physical desktop partially interactive. We present PLink and initial results from a multi-week field study.'
