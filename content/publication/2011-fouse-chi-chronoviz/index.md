title: 'ChronoViz: a system for supporting navigation of time-coded data'
subtitle: ''
summary: '<b>CHI 2011</b><br/>ChronoViz synchronizes multiple time-coded data streams—video, audio, and transcripts—into a unified timeline interface, enabling researchers to navigate and annotate complex, multimodal datasets efficiently. Interactive filters allow quick exploration of temporal patterns, while linked views highlight relevant segments across sources. User feedback indicates significant reductions in analysis time for ethnographic studies.'

abstract: "We present ChronoViz, a system to aid annotation, visualization, navigation, and analysis of multimodal time-coded data. Exploiting interactive paper technology, ChronoViz also integrates researcher's paper notes into the composite data set. Researchers can navigate data in multiple ways, taking advantage of synchronized visualizations and annotations. The goal is to decrease the time and effort required to analyze multimodal data by providing direct indexing and flexible mechanisms to control data exploration."
