abstract: 'In this demo we present a system which recognizes and interprets the semantics of handwritten annotations on printed documents. The semantic information is sent to the Semantic Desktop, the personal Semantic Web on the desktop computer, which supports users in their information management. This allows a seamless integration of interactive paper into the individual knowledge work. The current implementation of the proposed system works with OpenOffice documents printed on Anoto paper. The system properties and a use case are described in this paper.'
