abstract: 'Adaptive radiation therapy aims to account for patientsâ€™ continuous anatomical changes and update the treatment plans on a daily basis. Despite the potential benefits, technological limitations hinder clinical adoption: daily re-evaluation of contours associated with adaptive planning is time-intensive and difficult to access, and often requires direct provider input which classically involves visualizing and editing contours on immobile desktop computers. This project evaluated the efficacy of everyday touch devices (i.e., tablet and phone) for contouring using a novel cross-platform interface.'
