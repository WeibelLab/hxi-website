abstract: 'Digital pen and paper technologies provide the basis for linking digital content and services to printed materials in the form of interactive paper publications. To realise the potential of these technologies, it is important to develop platforms and tools that can support the large-scale publishing of interactive paper documents. We show how an extensible content management system that was developed to support context-aware publishing was used for the production of interactive paper documents. The publishing process consists of two phases and requires one channel to support the production of the document together with cross-media link definitions and a second channel to support interaction with the document.'
