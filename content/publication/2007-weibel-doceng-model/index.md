abstract: 'The first steps towards bridging the paper-digital divide have been achieved with the development of a range of technologies that allow printed documents to be linked to digital content and services. However, the static nature of paper and limited structural information encoded in classical paginated formats make it difficult to map between parts of a printed instance of a document and logical elements of a digital instance of the same document, especially taking document revisions into account. We present a solution to this problem based on a model that combines metadata of the digital and printed instances to enable a seamless mapping between digital documents and their physical counterparts on paper. We also describe how the model was used to develop iDoc, a framework that supports the authoring and publishing of interactive paper documents.'
