abstract: 'We present AwareNews, a context-aware ambient news and awareness display. The aim of the system is to improve the awareness of the members of an organisation about news and activities regarding the organisation itself as well as related topics and general news and events. AwareNews integrates various information sources, filters the information objects and makes them available to the users through peripheral displays distributed throughout the office environment. A prototype of the system has been implemented and deployed in our research group. A qualitative user study was conducted to gather feedback from the users and analyse the effects of the AwareNews application.'
