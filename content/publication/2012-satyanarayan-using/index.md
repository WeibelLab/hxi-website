title: Using overlays to support collaborative interaction with display walls
subtitle: ''
summary: '<b>IUI 2012</b><br/>Overlays allow multiple users to annotate ultra-scale display walls simultaneously by projecting personalized transparent layers, enabling private notes and group discussion without obscuring base content. Each participantâ€™s input appears on separate virtual layers, reducing interference and enhancing coordination. User feedback indicates overlays improve task parallelism and decrease communication overhead in collaborative teams.'
