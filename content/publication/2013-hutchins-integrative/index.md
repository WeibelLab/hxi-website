summary: '<b>JCEDM 2013</b><br/>Multimodal study combines digital pens, video, and cockpit instrumentation to analyze pilot decision processes during flight. By synchronizing pen-based notes with audio-video and flight data, the approach reveals patterns of communication and workload. Findings inform design of cockpit interfaces to enhance situational awareness and reduce errors.'
