summary: '<b>CSCW 2012</b><br/>Pen-based toolkit enables educators to create collaborative language-learning exercises by combining paper worksheets with digital pens, automatically syncing handwritten responses to shared tablets. Instructors define prompts on paper; student answers are captured digitally for group review, fostering interactive peer feedback. Usability tests show increased engagement and seamless transition between analog and digital environments.'
