title: Microanalysis of active reading behavior to inform design of interactive desktop
  workspaces
subtitle: ''
summary: '<b>ITS 2012</b><br/>Detailed study of reading activities uses video and gaze tracking to capture how users annotate, scroll, and reference documents on desktop displays. Analysis identifies patterns such as frequent context-switching and multitasking, guiding design of interactive workspaces that integrate pen, touch, and keyboard inputs. Recommendations include adaptive layouts and gesture shortcuts to reduce cognitive load during active reading sessions.'
