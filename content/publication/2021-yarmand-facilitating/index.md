abstract: 'Co-location matters, especially when running collaborative design thinking workshops. What if participation cannot occur in person? How can we conduct these workshops remotely? Based on guidelines of the Wallet project that provides a framework for in-person design thinking workshops, we present the first experiences of facilitating 2 remote design workshops with radiation oncology faculty and residents. We report the logistics and tool support decisions for the first workshop, evaluate and adjust our approach for the second workshop, and present the 3 lessons learned: incorporating schedule flexibility, prioritizing technology familiarity, and integrating communication channels.'
