abstract: Traumatic injuries require timely intervention, but medical expertise
  is not always available at the patientâ€™s location. Despite recent advances in
  telecommunications, surgeons still have limited tools to remotely help
  inexperienced surgeons. Mixed Reality hints at a future where remote
  collaborators work side-by-side as if co-located; however, we still do not
  know how current technology can improve remote surgical collaboration. Through
  role-playing and iterative-prototyping, we identify collaboration practices
  used by expert surgeons to aid novice surgeons as well as technical
  requirements to facilitate these practices. We then introduce ARTEMIS, an
  AR-VR collaboration system that supports these key practices. Through an
  observational study with two expert surgeons and five novice surgeons
  operating on cadavers, we find that ARTEMIS supports remote surgical mentoring
  of novices through synchronous point, draw, and look affordances and
  asynchronous video clips. Most participants found that ARTEMIS facilitates
  collaboration despite existing technology limitations explored in this paper.

summary: In this paper, we describe ARTEMIS' design process with a summary of
  specific user goals ARTEMIS addresses. We also describe the system
  implementation and show an early validation of how the system addresses user
  goals.
