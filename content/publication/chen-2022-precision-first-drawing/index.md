abstract: 'Accurately drawing non–planar 3D curves in immersive Virtual Reality (VR) is indispensable for many precise 3D tasks. However, due to lack of physical support, limited depth perception, and the non–planar nature of 3D curves, it is challenging to adjust mid–air strokes to achieve high precision. Instead of creating new interaction techniques, we investigated how task geometric shapes and input modalities affect precision–first drawing performance in a within–subject study (n = 12) focusing on 3D target tracing in commercially available VR headsets. We found that compared to using bare hands, VR controllers and pens yield nearly 30% of precision gain, and that the tasks with large curvature, forward–backward or left–right orientations perform best. We finally discuss opportunities for designing novel interaction techniques for precise 3D drawing. We believe that our work will benefit future research aiming to create usable toolboxes for precise 3D drawing.'
