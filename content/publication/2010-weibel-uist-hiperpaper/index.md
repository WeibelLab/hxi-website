title: Exploring pen and paper interaction with high-resolution wall displays
subtitle: ''
summary: '<b>UIST 2010</b><br/>Hiperpaper integrates pen-and-paper controls with ultra-scale wall displays, allowing users to sketch on standard paper that appears at full resolution on massive screens. The system uses overhead cameras to capture ink and position data, enabling seamless transitions between tangible and digital drawing. Participants reported improved accuracy and fluidity when switching across mediums compared to typical tablet-only workflows.'

abstract: 'We introduce HIPerPaper, a novel digital pen and paper interface that enables natural interaction with a 31.8 by 7.5 foot tiled wall display of 268,720,000 pixels. HIPerPaper provides a flexible, portable, and inexpensive medium for interacting with large high-resolution wall displays. While the size and resolution of such displays allow visualization of data sets of a scale not previously possible, mechanisms for interacting with wall displays remain challenging. HIPerPaper enables multiple concurrent users to select, move, scale, and rotate objects on a high-dimension wall display.'
