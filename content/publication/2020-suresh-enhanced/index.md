abstract: 'Systems, devices, and methods are disclosed for an enhanced ultrasound system. A system may include an ultrasound probe. The system may include processing circuitry communicatively coupled to the ultrasound probe. The system may also include an AR device receiving image information from the processing circuitry and displaying one or more ultrasound images from the ultrasound probe in the field of view of an operator.'
