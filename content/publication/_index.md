The HXI research lab publishes across Computer Science, Design, Human-computer Interaction, and domain-specific venues such as healthcare-related journals. 

Primary mean of publication for computing research, are conference proceedings. Many conferences organized by <a href="http://acm.org">ACM</a> (e.g., [CHI](https://chi.acm.org), [UbiComp](http://ubicomp.org), [UIST](https://uist.acm.org/), [CSCW](https://cscw.acm.org/), [IUI](https://iui.acm.org/), [ASSETS](https://www.sigaccess.org/assets/), etc.) and <a href="https://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a> (e.g., [ISMAR](https://www.ismar.net/), [IEEE VR](https://ieeevr.org) etc.) are considered top publication venues for human-computer interaction. Sometimes, we also published at journals such as [TOCHI](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tochi), [IMWUT](https://dl.acm.org/journal/imwut) and [PACMHCI](https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci).
