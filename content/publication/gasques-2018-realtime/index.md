abstract: 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is a life-saving procedure that gives a cardiac arrest victim a second chance.
The application window is short as the chances of survival
falls drastically with every minute without resuscitation. Outofhospital cardiac arrests are even riskier, as the state of victim
worsens while waiting for specialized medical personnel. CPR
is simple and composed of few steps, with instructions widely
available in First Aid Kits or online. Nonetheless, it is usually not performed by most bystanders as they fear to harm
the victim by its incorrect application. Recently, the introduction of Mixed Reality (MR) devices such as Microsoft
HoloLens enabled the development of systems that leverage
contextual information such as the location of the victim to
display guiding information where it should be performed,
thereby allowing bystanders to focus on the task at hand. In
this demo, we present HoloCPR, a Mixed Reality application
that provides real-time instructions for performing CPR'
