title: 'PaperSketch: a paper-digital collaborative remote sketching tool'
subtitle: ''
summary: '<b>IUI 2011</b><br/>PaperSketch bridges paper and digital whiteboards for remote teams by capturing sketches on paper and streaming them live to a shared canvas. Low-latency ink recognition ensures that collaborators see each otherâ€™s drawings in real time, enabling fluid, co-located feels despite physical distance. User studies indicate increased creativity and coordination compared to voice-only collaboration.'
