Iâ€™m a Computer Science Ph.D. student from the University of California San Diego, affiliating with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Design Lab and The Human-centered eXtended Intelligence Research Lab. My research is on Human-Computer Interactions (HCI), where I work on designing eXtended Reality (XR) User Interfaces and Conversational User Interfaces for Healthcare and General Workspaces. I was also a former Research Scientist Intern at Adobe Research. And my work has been awarded with Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship (Finalist) in 2019, and Adobe Research Fellowship (Finalist) in 2022.
