Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science from UC San Diego advised by Prof. Nadir Weibel. My thesis committee also includes Prof. James D. Hollan, Prof. Haijun Xia, Prof. William G. Grisworld, Prof. Yang Zhang and Dr. Cuong Nguyen. I am affiliated with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Design Lab, as well as Qualcomm Institute @CalIT2.

My research interest is on Human-Computer Interactions (HCI), Accessibility (A11y) and Healthcare. My thesis aims to **augment content interaction experiences with 3D, within 3D, and for 3D**. These 3D experiences encompass those **rendered on standard 2D displays**, and those **experienced through emerging head-mounted displays**.

I am a former researcher at Microsoft Research, Adobe Research and Carnegie Mellon University. For more information, feel free to visit [my website](https://chen-chen.me). If you are interested in my work, feel free to email me!
