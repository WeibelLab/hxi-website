Iâ€™m a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate from the University of California San Diego, affiliating with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Design Lab and The Human-centered eXtended Intelligence Research Lab. My research is on Human-Computer Interactions (HCI), where I work on designing eXtended Reality (XR) User Interfaces and Conversational User Interfaces for Healthcare and General Workspaces. I was a former Research Scientist Intern at Adobe Research and a former staff researcher in Department of Software and Societal Systems in School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. My past work has been awarded with Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship (Finalist) in 2019, and Adobe Research Fellowship (Finalist) in 2022. I am an alumni from Carnegie Mellon University (M.S. ECE '17) and The University of Nottingham in the UK (B.E.ng Hons 1st Class EEE '16).
