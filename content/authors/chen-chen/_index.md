I am an incoming Assistant Professor ü§ì at the Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Sciences üíª, part of the College of Engineering and Computing at Florida International University üêÖ in Miami üå¥ starting Fall 2025.

I will complete my Ph.D. in Computer Science üíª from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and The Design Lab at UC San Diego üî±. I was a former researcher at Microsoft Research, Adobe Research and Carnegie Mellon University üêï. My research has been recognized with a Distinguished Paper Award from ACM IMWUT, an Honorable Mention Award from ACM CHI, a Best Poster Runner-Up Award from ACM SenSys, the BP Scholarship, and has been selected as a finalist for the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship and the Adobe Research Fellowship. I received my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, and a B.Eng. (First Class, Hons.) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University of Nottingham.
