Dr. Nadir Weibel is a Professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.ucsd.edu) at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu), and the Associate Faculty Director of the [UCSD Design Lab](https://designlab.ucsd.edu/). Dr. Weibel is also a Research Health Science Specialist at the [VA San Diego Health System](https://www.sandiego.va.gov/), and he is affiliated with the [Contextual Robotics Institute](https://contextualrobotics.ucsd.edu/), the [Center for Population and Health Systems](https://cwphs.ucsd.edu/), and the [Research Center on Optimal Digital Ethics](https://recode.health).

His work intersects computer science, human-centered design, and time-critical domains such as healthcare, education, and automation. Dr. Weibel and his team design and evaluate interactive systems integrating eXtended Reality (XR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and pervasive sensing technologies, leveraging multimodal data —- body and eye movements, physiological signals, speech, and social interactions—to enhance human behavior in real-world and digital environments. This research bridges human needs and computational systems, addressing critical challenges in equitable healthcare delivery, education, and social equity.

To pursue his research Dr. Weibel develop tools and prototypes combining generative AI with XR for adaptive learning, ethical AI frameworks for life-critical domains, and multimodal systems using depth cameras, eye tracking, wearables, and XR. These efforts address systemic inequities and deliver human-centered solutions with real-world impact, spanning radiation oncology training, remote surgical mentoring, and mental health interventions.
