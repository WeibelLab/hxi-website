Hello! My name is Danilo Gasques, and I am a <b>Computer Science Ph.D. Candidate</b> at UC San Diego (<a href="https://www.ubicomp.ucsd.edu/">HXI Lab</a> / <a href="https://design.ucsd.edu">Design Lab</a>).

In my research, I use <i>mixed methods</i> to better understand user goals, co-design with stakeholders, and evaluate and explain interventions. I also develop prototypes, tools, and systems. For example, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290607.3312847">tools to facilitate the rapid-prototyping of Augmented Reality applications</a>.
