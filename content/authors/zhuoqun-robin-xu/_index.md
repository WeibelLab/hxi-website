Robin is a Master student in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at UC San Diego, working with Human-Centered eXtended Intelligence lab, California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology. He is also a member of the [UCSD Design Lab](https://designlab.ucsd.edu/) and [Arthur C. Clarke Center for Human Imagination](http://imagination.ucsd.edu/). With the background of Bachelor degree in Speculative Design, Robin is eager to learn and define the potential systematic futures for our social, political, technological lives.

Robin have some experience of Extended Reality research and development on medical applications & learning technologies with C#, C++, Java and OpenGL. He is dedicated on designing the software for human perception and connection and eager to get further depth on learning and understanding the relation between human somatic sensing and social behavior.

His main research mostly focuses on Mixed reality HCI design, game development, and telepresence. He has 7 years of experience working in visual design and cinematic practice and more than 4 years of interactive application development, including K12 education, healthcare, neuroscience research. He still perusing his ultimate passion of interaction - Extended Really (**XR**) - in order to bring up the connection between **You** and **Us**.
