We work at the intersection of computer science, cognitive science, and design to understand how pervasive and emerging technologies can help bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds, especially in the sphere of health and healthcare. 

The Human-Centered and Ubiquitous Computing Lab (Weibel Lab) focuses on the design, development and evaluation of interactive pervasive sensing technology to support health and healthcare. Our team, led by Dr. Nadir Weibel, investigates, designs and develops new tools, techniques and infrastructure that leverage the power of multimodal and pervasive sensing to track body and eye movements, speech, writing, as well as social interaction in the real world and online. This allows us to first capture, quantify and understand human behavior and then support better interaction with information through the design and development of human-centered ubiquitous computing technology that improve health and health care.

Current research is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), the Department of Veteran Affairs, the UC San Diego Office of Research Affairs, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Moxie Foundation. Additional funding for previous projects was provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), the European Union (FP6), and Boeing
